# Javascript Bot Showcase

A showcase of various javascript bots and bookmarklets as a chrome extension.

A variety of bots written over the years, also used as bookmarklets.

To make them easier to collate I have created an extension for them all.

- download the repo somewhere
- `chrome://extensions`
- add the `/extension` folder via 'load unpacked'
- use the context menu on the various sites
- check the console to see the bot code and the code as a bookmarklet
